# Election_Plugin
A Spigot plugin made for in-game elections

---
### This plugin is in alpha, and was not made for public use
It works, but is not very user friendly, and there is little config,
I will eventually make a better version, and make everything a bit more user friendly,

See the development section below.


# Usage
- Download the .jar file from [Releases](https://github.com/AsoDesu/Election_Plugin/releases), and put it in your `plugins` folder
- Run the command /election players ... (4 players) *Currently, this plugin must have 4 players, no more, no less*
- Hold as many paper as you want voting slips, e.g. Holding 8 paper, will turn them into 8 voting slips
- Then run the command /election start
- Give the voting slips to the players, through a chest, dropper, or just drop them
---
- **If twitch integration is enabled, type 1-4 in chat**
- Click while holding the paper, click on the player head of the person you want to vote for
- Drop the paper in the hopper
---
- Run the command /election results, and you get the results, in order, with the number of votes!!

# Development
Plans for development:
- Allow any number of candidates (right now, strictly 4)
- More user friendly...
- More checks for errors
- Better GUI management
- More config options
